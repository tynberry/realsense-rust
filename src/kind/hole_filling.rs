//! Enumeration of methods that can be used to fill invalid pixels.
//!
//! The filter implements several methods to rectify missing data in the resulting image.
//! The filter obtains the four immediate pixel "neighbors" (up, down ,left, right), and
//! selects one of them according to a user-defined rule.
//!
//! See the [RealSense post-processing documentation](https://dev.intelrealsense.com/docs/post-processing-filters)
