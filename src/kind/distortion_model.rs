//! Enumeration describing the possible kinds of distortions present in a stream profile.
//!
//! Different RealSense devices use different distortion models to describe their intrinsics. For instance, the D415
//! uses the Modified Brown Conrady distortion model on its color camera, while the SR300 uses the Inverse Brown
//! Conrady. Ultimately, the user will need to interrogate a Stream's intrinsics directly using `.intrinsics()` to be
//! sure about the model being used.
//!
//! See the Intel docs about [Projection in RealSense SDK
//! 2.0](https://dev.intelrealsense.com/docs/projection-in-intel-realsense-sdk-20) for more information.
